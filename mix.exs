    Library for making textual reports, similar to the `diff` command-line
    utility, of the differences between two lists of objects
    (of whatever type), or two strings, broken up on newlines
    (or any other substring).  Also can return a list of differences between
    two lists of objects, as a list rather than a textual report, but still
    marked with not only additions and removals but also _changes_,
    marking the old and new versions.
